# GIF Compressor and Resizer

A Streamlit web application that allows users to upload GIF images, adjust compression settings such as quality and resize dimensions, and then download the compressed GIF. This app uses Python's `Pillow` library for image processing and `Streamlit` for the user interface.

## Features

- **Upload GIFs:** Users can upload any GIF file.
- **Compression Settings:**
  - **Resize Width and Height:** Allows resizing the GIF while maintaining the aspect ratio.
  - **Frame Duration:** Adjust the duration of each frame in milliseconds.
  - **Optimize GIF:** Option to optimize the GIF to reduce file size.
  - **Number of Loops:** Set how many times the GIF should loop (`0` for infinite looping).
- **Preview Original and Compressed GIFs:** Users can see both the original and the compressed versions.
- **Download Compressed GIF:** Provides a download button for the compressed GIF.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7 or higher** installed on your system.
- **pip** package manager (usually included with Python).

### Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to keep dependencies isolated.

#### For Windows:

1. **Open Command Prompt or PowerShell.**
2. **Navigate to your project directory:**

 

3. Create a virtual environment:
  ```bash
 cd path\to\your\project
   python -m venv venv

4. Activate the virtual environment:
venv\Scripts\activate

Note for PowerShell Users:
If you encounter an error about script execution policies, run PowerShell as an administrator and execute:

Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

5. Install Dependencies
With the virtual environment activated, install the required packages using the provided requirements.txt file:

bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
